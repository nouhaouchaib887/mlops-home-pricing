#  Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Context

**Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis** is an end-to-end system for predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using machine learning. The project emphasizes **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **automated deployment workflows**.

The goal is not only to accurately predict client subscription but also to implement a **robust operational framework** for **continuous improvement**, **reproducibility**, and **monitoring at scale**.

## Key Concepts and Practices

This project integrates modern data science and MLOps practices:

### Design Patterns
Key design patterns are implemented to ensure **clean, maintainable, and extensible code**:

#### Factory Method Pattern
Used to create different **data ingestion components** (CSV, database, API):

#### Strategy Pattern  
Applied for flexible **EDA approaches, feature engineering, and model selection strategies**:

### Version Control
- Git is used for tracking code changes and managing branches.
- DVC (Data Version Control) may be used for dataset versioning and reproducibility.

### Modular Architecture
- Modular code organization following clean architecture principles (data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, serving, etc.)

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Automated testing, linting, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- Model retraining pipelines triggered on new data or code updates.

### Experiment Tracking
- MLflow or Weights & Biases for tracking experiments, hyperparameters, and model performance metrics.

### Model Registry
- Centralized registry for storing and versioning trained models.
- Promoting models from staging to production based on evaluation metrics.

### Scalable Infrastructure
- Containerization with Docker.
- Optional orchestration using Kubernetes or cloud services (Azure, AWS, GCP).
- Offline vs online inference paths for real-time campaign scoring.

### Monitoring & Evaluation
- Monitoring for data drift, model performance, and serving metrics.
- Alerts for performance drops or anomalies in production campaigns.
